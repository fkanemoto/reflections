What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

	A tracking file .git is created and
	the changes in the files that are
	in the directoy	are able to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area let us know wich file we
	want the changes to be tracked. It is important
	to organize what we want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Using "git diff --staged" I can see what
	change I want to commit and if it is
	only one logical change.
